title: Client Setup
description: How to setup your clients to work with Tenure
---

Tenure works with any OpenAI-compatible client. Point it at `http://localhost:5757/v1` with your bearer token and it routes through Tenure automatically.

> **Docker networking note:** If your client runs in Docker, `localhost` won't resolve to your host machine. Use `http://host.docker.internal:5757/v1` instead (Docker Desktop on Mac/Windows) or your host's LAN IP on Linux.

## Chat

Chat interfaces are where Tenure does its best work. Brainstorming, deciding, refining; the reasoning that happens here builds your belief store over time.

| Client                              | Integration     | Status      |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| [Open WebUI](clients/open-webui.md) | Point and shoot | Supported   |
| [LibreChat](clients/librechat.md)   | Point and shoot | Coming soon |
| [Onyx](clients/onyx.md)             | Point and shoot | Coming soon |

**Point and shoot setup:** In your client's API settings, set the base URL to `http://localhost:5757/v1` and paste your bearer token. Select any model and start chatting.

## IDE

IDE clients receive a memory-informed context on every request. Your preferences, decisions, and project conventions are injected automatically without extra setup.

The [VS Code extension](clients/vscode.md) adds real-time workspace scope resolution, so Tenure knows which project you're working in before your first message is sent. It covers any IDE built on VS Code.

| Client                                | Integration      | Status      |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| [VS Code](clients/vscode.md)          | Native extension | Supported   |
| [Cursor](clients/cursor.md)           | Native extension | Supported   |
| [Windsurf](clients/windsurf.md)       | Native extension | Supported   |
| [Cline](clients/cline.md)             | Native extension | Supported   |
| [Continue](clients/continue.md)       | Native extension | Supported   |
| [Claude Code](clients/claude-code.md) | Point and shoot  | Coming soon |

**Point and shoot setup:** In your IDE's AI settings, replace the base URL with `http://localhost:5757/v1` and add your bearer token.

## Agents

Agent integrations run Tenure as a plugin inside the agent framework itself, with automatic per-agent memory isolation. Memory written in one agent never surfaces in another.

| Client                          | Integration   | Status    |
| ------------------------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| [OpenClaw](clients/openclaw.md) | Native plugin | Supported |

## Manual mode

If you prefer to manage your belief store by hand, extraction can be disabled entirely. Tenure still injects whatever you have authored into every session.

To disable extraction globally: **Admin Panel > Settings > Extraction > Enabled: off**

To disable per-session, add a request header: `X-Tenure-No-Extract: true`

Or type `!extract off` directly in your chat session.
